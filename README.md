Hi, firstly, I would like to mention in the modal, there will be fixed data for one view, I putted only to show you how it looks.

Second, on appointment in calendar there should be 'VIEWINGS', I have putted length of attachments array.
Third, I have used json-graphql-server so I needed to remove "__typename" key from every object and I removed data obj and appointments, only left is array nodes with data, so I belive this wont be problem.

Thanks.
